This is a charm that uses the sample prometheus client from https://github.com/prometheus/client_golang/tree/master/examples/random.
Its main purpose is to demonstrate and test the usage of the prometheus interface layer (https://github.com/tasdomas/juju-interface-prometheus).

To use the charm, make sure that the ```charm``` tool is installed. Then:
```
$ make all
$ juju deploy --series trusty $(JUJU_REPOSITORY)/trusty/prometheus-client
```

To start collecting metrics from this service with a deployed prometheus instance (https://github.com/tasdomas/juju-charm-prometheus), simply
relate the two services together:
```
$ juju add-relation prometheus-client:prometheus prometheus:scrape
```
